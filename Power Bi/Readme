Power BI

This custom Power BI report illustrates the process and advantages of migrating from WebFOCUS to a contemporary, AI-enabled cloud platform. 
Designed to facilitate data-driven decision-making, highlighting the following key features:

  •	Seamless Microsoft Integration: Effortlessly connect with other Microsoft tools such as Azure, Office 365, and Teams for streamlined workflows.
  •	Rapid Deployment: Accelerate deployment timelines with minimal disruption to existing operations.
  •	Scalability: Easily scale data processing and visualization capabilities to meet growing organizational needs.
  •	User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive design ensures users can quickly access insights without extensive training.
  •	Cost Efficiency: Reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs associated with legacy systems.
  •	Reduced IT Dependency: Empower users with self-service analytics, decreasing reliance on IT support.

Additionally, this report emphasizes the importance of preparing, modeling, visualizing, analyzing, and managing data via Power BI to maximize
value and insights. 

This report aims to demonstrate how organizations can modernize their analytics infrastructure efficiently and effectively, leveraging AI and 
cloud technologies for enhanced operational insights.

Python, Bubble, and Scatter
•	Python Visuals: Power BI's Python visuals are static images and do not support native interactivity such as tooltips or hover effects. If interactivity is a priority, it's recommended to use Power BI's built-in visuals. Creating bubble or scatter plots with Power BI's native scatter chart ensures seamless integration with filtering, highlighting, and detailed tooltip functionalities.
•	Bubble Chart: A variation of a scatter chart that uses bubbles to represent three data points. The x and y axes correspond to two numeric values, while the size of each bubble reflects a third numerical field, representing a third dimension of data. You can also enable coloring of the bubbles to visualize relationships and patterns within your dataset.
•	Scatter Plot: A visualization that uses dots to depict the relationship between two numerical variables—one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis—helping identify patterns and correlations.
  o	Animation: Dragging a time-based field to the Play Axis allows you to animate the scatter plot over time, illustrating how data points change daily, monthly, or yearly.
  o	Customization: Dragging a categorical field to the Legend field enables color-coding of data points, providing additional context and enhancing interpretability.

Python
•	Two Python scripts are used to render static images.
•	Additionally, two scripts were created with hover functionality. However, the visual is rendered in a new browser tab rather than directly on the Power BI report canvas.

Limitations in Power BI
Power BI’s Python visuals are primarily designed to display static images. Interactive features such as tooltips or hover effects are limited. 

Currently, Power BI does not support embedding Python visuals directly onto the report page in the same way as native visuals. Instead, Python visuals are rendered within a dedicated container, which appears as a separate object on the report. When hover functionality is included in Python scripts, the output typically appears in this container, often opening in a new window or tab.

Error Message Explanation
The message “Can’t display this visual. See details.” appears when attempting to embed Python scripts with hover interactivity. This occurs because the output is rendered within the Python visual container, which functions as a separate window rather than directly on the report canvas.
